# Employee Attrition Analysis 📊

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Employee Attrition Analysis using Python, where raw HR data is cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to uncover key factors contributing to employee turnover.
The analysis uses Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to extract actionable insights.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw attrition data

Perform data transformation for analysis readiness

Analyze employee attrition patterns

Visualize key trends and relationships

Identify factors influencing employee attrition

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – data cleaning and transformation

Matplotlib – data visualization

Seaborn – statistical and advanced visualizations

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains employee-related attributes such as:

Demographic information

Job role and department

Salary and work experience

Job satisfaction and performance

Attrition status (Yes/No)

🧹 Data Cleaning

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

Handling missing and null values

Removing duplicate records

Correcting data types

Renaming columns for consistency

Standardizing categorical values

🔄 Data Transformation

Data transformation included:

Encoding categorical variables

Creating derived features

Grouping and aggregating data

Filtering relevant records for analysis

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analyses performed:

Overall attrition rate

Attrition by department and job role

Impact of salary, experience, and age on attrition

Correlation analysis between numerical features

Distribution analysis using histograms and box plots

📈 Visualizations

The project includes:

Bar charts for categorical comparisons

Count plots for attrition distribution

Box plots to identify salary and experience impact

Heatmaps to show correlations

All visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🔍 Key Insights

Certain departments show higher attrition rates

Lower salary bands have higher employee turnover

Employees with less experience tend to leave more frequently

Job satisfaction has a strong relationship with attrition

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow—from raw data cleaning to visualization and insight generation.
It can help organizations understand attrition trends and take data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.
